Contains the PLC vacuum libraries developed by the SLAC team for use in our PLC project, use these library files for the official release to build against instead of the corresponding github repos for the library code.

Install each file via the Twincat PLC library repository tool.  The files will probably end up in  the directory C:\TwinCAT\3.1\Components\Plc\Managed Libraries\SLAC\... with a subdirectory there for each library.
